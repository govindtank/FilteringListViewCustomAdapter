# FilteringListViewCustomAdapter
A simple Android application that can filter a ListView full of custom objects either with an EditText or with a SearchManager.

## Details

This app with a strange name shows a ListView populated with a class named Person. It's a simple class that defines objects with two Strings: a name and a surname.
Also the ArrayAdapter is custom so every row of the ListView shows both name and surname of every Person.

The point is that the code shows how you can filter the list using an EditText (at the top of the ListView) and a SearchManager in the menu.

## License

There is no license on this code because is just an exercise I do for myself. I just hope this helps someone.
